I submit the following for assessment as my best class.

* The method put(char piece) in class Grid.
* The method getViablePiecePlacement(String placement, String objective) in class StepsGame.
* The method getGridCoord() and getPiecePlacement() in class Board.

I declare that this is entirely my own work.
