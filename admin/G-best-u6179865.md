I submit the following for assessment as my best class.

* The method *getSolutionsIterator()* in class StepGame.
* THe method *task11()* in class StepGame.

I declare that this is entirely my own work, with the following documented exceptions:

* The code in class <*getSolutionsIterator()*> uses an idea suggested by <The homework 'cost', where I also created an iterator, which was under the discussion with Jiawen He>
